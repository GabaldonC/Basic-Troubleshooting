				After the device has completly shutdown it is best to wait 1-5 minute before powering it
				back up again to see if your issue has been resolved.

			<li>
				If you are unable to access the <b>Start Menu</b> due to your device being frozen or some other
				issue like that press and hold down the power button for 15-20 seconds to turn the device off.
			</li>

				In cases that you are dealing with a desktop and are unable to turn the device off with the power
				button, you can reach behind the device and pull out the large 3 prong plug on the back and leave
				it unplugged for 15-20 seconds before plugging it back in and attempting to turn the device back on.
