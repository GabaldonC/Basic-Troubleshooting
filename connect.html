		<h1>Network Connection Guide</h1>
		<p>
			If a tech is unable to get to you at the moment and you are having problems with printing, accessing
			a website you currently use, or having internet problems in general, try following these steps
			to check and change your network connection and see if that resolves your problem.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				First look for these following symbols in the bottom right hand corner of your screen.
			</li>
			<img src="assets/connect_1.png">
			<p>
				Depending on the symbol you see take the following steps:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> <b>Cable:</b> If you see this symbol you should be connected to the network and should
					be able to print as well as access everything else. If that isn't the case it may be a
					larger problem with the network and it is best to wait for a tech to take a look at your
					issue.
				</li>
				<li> <b>Wi-Fi:</b> If you see a wifi symbol it is best to click on it and check to see what network
					you're connected to. If you're connected to <b>BCS_Guest</b> try moving to <b>BCS_Wireless</b>
					as our printers and certain websites are blocked on <b>BCS_Guest</b> so they can't be used by
					our students.
				</li>
				<li> <b>Wi-Fi Available:</b> If you see this symbol that means that there is a wifi network available
					but you simply aren't connected to it. To fix this click the symbol in the bottom right hand corner
					and connect yourself to <b>BCS_Wireless</b>.
				</li>
				<li> <b>Network Unavailable:</b> If you see this symbol that means that for some reason your device
					is unable to see or connect to any network. In this case it would be best for you to follow 
					<a href="power.html">Power Cycling The Device</a>.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				If none of the following steps were able to fix the issue you are having wait for a tech
				to come and assist you.
